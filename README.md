This repository is my experiments of Caffe2 framework for my practise.

1. The first example include implementation of LeNet network for MNIST database. [Link](lenet-mnist/)
2. CIFAR 10 caffe2 training and inference. [Link](cifar10-cnn)
3. [Caffe2 Utils](caffe2_utils) - These are the common functions that are used for general training and testing. Also, methods are included to create a database in minidb. (Note: Some of the methods are taken from caffe2 tutorials.)
