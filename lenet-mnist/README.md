## LENET Architecture

The dataset used for this implementation is the MNIST [dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

Note: This example has been taken from caffe2 examples [Link](https://caffe2.ai/docs/tutorial-MNIST.html)

## Requirements:
1. Pre installed caffe2.
2. python 2.7

## How to run the program:
In order to run the program use the following command:

```
python mnist-trainer.py > statistics.log
```

This creates a log file which has all the statistics for the number of iterations the model is trained on.
Also, the root directory contains all the required folders that are used for statistics.
You can see a simple log file that has been trained for 400 iterations.
